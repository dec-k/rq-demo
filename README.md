# `react-query` Demo.

Super super limited demo showcasing some of the more interesting functionality in react-query.

- Automatic retry policy.
- Stale refresh management. (Click off the tab and back onto it).
- Hook-based query observation (no prop drilling or bloat from redux/zust)

`npm install && npm run dev`
